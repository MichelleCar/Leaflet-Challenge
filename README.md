# Leaflet: An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
## _Case Study: Earthquake Vizualization_

### Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

### Why Leaflet JS is the best tool for the task?
Leaflet is one of the most popular open-source JavaScript libraries for interactive maps. For these reasons, Leaflet is probably the most popular open-source web-mapping library at the moment. As the Leaflet home page puts it, the guiding principle behind this library is simplicity:

“Leaflet doesn’t try to do everything for everyone. Instead it focuses on making the basic things work perfectly.”

Advanced functionality is still available through Leaflet plugins. 

It’s used by websites ranging from The New York Times and The Washington Post to GitHub and Flickr, as well as GIS specialists like OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and CartoDB. The San Francisco Chronicle, for example, did a project called the California Fire tracker [California Fire tracker](#https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/california-fire-map/)    — an interactive map that provides information on wildfires burning across California, using Leaflet. Not only did they pinpoint the origin of the fire, but they also showed us the trajectory of it.

Some features include:
* Interactive panning/zooming
* Compose maps using arbitrary combinations of:
    * Map tiles
    * Markers
    * Polygons
    * Lines
    * Popups
    * GeoJSON
* Augment map features using chosen plugins from leaflet plugins repository
